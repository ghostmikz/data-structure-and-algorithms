# Data Structures and Algorithms – Laboratory

This repository contains all laboratory works for the **Data Structures and Algorithms** course.  
Each lab includes **C source code** and instructions (if provided by the instructor).

## Repository Structure

- `lab01/`, `lab02/`, … – Each folder represents a laboratory work
  - `task.pdf` – Lab instructions (if provided)
  - `src/` – C source code for the lab

> **Note:** The course skips Lab 8, Lab 9, and Lab 12. The sequence goes from Lab 7 directly to Lab 10, and from Lab 11 to Lab 13.

## Language

- Primarily **C**
- Each lab is self-contained, so you can test them individually.

## How to Use

1. Open the `src/` folder of any lab to access the source code.
2. Compile and run the code using a terminal, e.g.:
```bash
gcc lab01/src/lab01.c -o lab01
./lab01
